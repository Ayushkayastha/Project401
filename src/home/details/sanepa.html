         organic food with ingredients from our own yard. We serve dishes in both typical 
         Nepali and western style. The open-air terrace is set up to have beautiful panoramic
          views of the area. You can watch our elephants walking through the flowered garden 
          for their daily bath and experience the lively atmosphere of local Tharu life.

         in a jeep or by foot & enjoy our elephant ethical activities. Our experienced guides
          are specialized in educational expeditions and will gladly tell you about the flora
           and fauna you will encounter. Other activities include an introduction to the 
           Tharu and Chepang culture through a trek into the mountains. From our location, 
           you can also visit many touristic hotspots such as Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Pokhara,
